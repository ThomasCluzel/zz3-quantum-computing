# Simple Quantum Adder

This project propose a basic implementation of an addition of 2 qubits
in a register of 5 qubits. Registers of qubits are represented as vectors of
complex coefficients and quantum gates are modeled as matrices.

## How to build the project

1. Download the latest stable version of _CMake_ from the [official webpage](https://cmake.org/download/)
1. Download and unzip _Boost_ from the [official webpage](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_71_0/more/getting_started/index.html)
1. Add the location of the library to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: `export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="path/to/boost_1_71_0"`
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <url of this project>`
1. `cd directory/of/the/project`
1. Run CMake to generate the makefile: `cmake -S . -B build`
1. Compile the project: `cmake --build build/`
1. Launch the simulator: `./build/main`

## How to run the unit tests

1. Build the project
1. `cd build/ ; ctest -V ; cd ..`

## Addition of two qubits in superposed states

We compute the addition of `(0.9|0> + 0.1|1>) + (0.8|0> + 0.2|1>)` without
carry. The qubits of the register represent `|carry, x, y, sum, next_carry>`
with `x` and `y` the qubits we want to add.

```
Initial superposed state of the register of 5 qubits:
(0.72,0), => |00000> (x=|0> and y=|0>)
(0,0),
(0,0),
(0,0),
(0.18,0), => |00100> (x=|0> and y=|1>)
(0,0),
(0,0),
(0,0),
(0.08,0), => |01000> (x=|1> and y=|0>)
