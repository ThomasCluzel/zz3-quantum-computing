# Quantum computing project

This repository contains the code of my final year project at ISIMA about Quantum Computing.

Two sub-projects live in this repository:
* a straightforward simulator in C++ with Boost uBLAS that adds two qubits.
* a list of experiments hold on IBM Q Experience (OpenQASM code and Qiskit notebooks).
